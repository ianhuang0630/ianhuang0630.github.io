                    Virtuals Oasis is an on-going project. I'm designing a 
                    virtual space in Oculus VR for fun meetings. More to come!

                    <h3 class=tab4> Travicus: Travis, but after puberty.</h3> 
                    <p> 
                    Travicus is a work in progress. Travis was nice, but I found
                    a few aspects wanting during day-to-day use:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1) The 3D printed enclosure, though uniquely in-house, 
                    breaks frequently from mechanical vibrations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2) Speaking of vibrations, the quality of Stanford's roads
                    has super high variance. I've had to pay far more attention
                    than I'd like to the quality of roads I skate on, as
                    excessively uneven and worn roads causes high discomfort
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    3) The single Turnigy Outrunner motor that I've been using
                    strains at startup, requiring me to give Travis a good push
                    at the beginning. If we're gonna use an electric skateboard,
                    lets be lazy all the way; let's get rid of the need for that 
                    push.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    4) The board's compactness is great when it comes to mounting
                    at the back of my backpack, but it comes with a higher risk
                    at high speeds. The increased instability is definitely a 
                    downside.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                    Travicus is going to come with some new features that gets
                    rid of these issues. For one, this time around its parts 
                    will be either machined out of sheetmetal or cut out of
                    a strong material using a laser cutter. It will also be a
                    four-wheel drive instead of a one-wheel drive (*), which
                    should give it more than enough power haul my bodyweight.
                    To combat the terrible asphalt conditions at Stanford, I'll
                    be equipping it with cloud suspension wheels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Here's the interesting part though: Travicus will be equipped
                    with a mechanism that will allow it to range in length from 
                    a compact 25 inches to a stabler 35-40 inches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you're interested in this idea and wanna help me make it 
                    a reality, shoot me an email!
                    </p>

                    <p class=footnote> * which may lend itself to software that 
                    steers the skateboard automatically ...? I've been dreaming
                    for a long time about a skateboard that can follow you as
                    you as you're walking, and for that to happen on a 
                    one-wheel drive, a steering mechanism would have to be
                    designed. With a four-wheel drive, perhaps differential 
                    speeds can get the job done.</p>

                    <h3 class=tab4> Travis: Building an electric skateboard from scratch</h3>
                    <p> 
                    To quote Feynman, "I cannot create, I do not understand". Against
                    the warning of everyone who were not blinded by my ignorance optimism,
                    I set out to create my own electric skateboard using circuits I design 
                    and solder myself, as well as 3d printed parts that I CADded (CADed?)
                    on Fusion360. Starting out with very little background in hardware and
                    electronics, I found it to be a very tough ride (pun intended). But 
                    countless broken 3D-printed parts and fried electrical circuits 
                    later, the project was finished. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    I've been using it to get around campus at Stanford. Here's a 
                    couple pictures of it in action. As you can see, its compactness 
                    allows it to be mounted at the back of a backpack to free up 
                    the hands, and the mace-like appearance of the controller keeps the 
                    bad guys on their toes. I've been thrown off of it a couple times 
                    (embarrassingly, sometimes infront of complete strangers) at 
                    the beginning due to poorly written firmware, but that 
                    quickly got smoothed over.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                    I have never topped out on speed (small boards tend to be a lot
                    less stable), and have also never exhausted its battery on a single trip.
                    I've used all the cheapest components for this prototype, and I think all 
                    parts added together would not cost more than $200. If you're interested 
                    in doing something similar, shoot me an email and I'd be happy to share 
                    code, circuit designs, CAD files and lessons I learned the hard way.

                    <h3 class=tab4> Motorized Camera </h3>
                    <p> 
                    With the rise of Zoom as the main way of communication 
                    during the coronavirus pandemic, a webcam is a must. 
                    But searching through the products available on the market, 
                    I was unsatsified. I wanted a 2-DOF motorized camera that 
                    I can control to look anywhere I want. This saves me the 
                    trouble of having to get up from my chair to turn the camera
                    up to the ceiling when I'm done with calls (for hackers/NSA).
                    I know that practically, it was going to be quite useless, 
                    but this itch of an idea existed to be scratched.

                    The whole project took half a day from design to 3d printing

                    <p> 
                    Two of my best friends from college had their birthdays
                    during the pandemic. That wasn't going to stop us from
                    partying it up. I made very extra websites for their 
                    birthdays, coupled with fun activities for the day. You
                    can check them out <a href=annas21st/index.html class=tab2>here</a> and 
                    <a href=huysimitationgames/index.html class=tab0>here</a>. If you want
                    to use the code for a birthday you're helping to celebrate
                    in the pandemic, just go ahead and use them. Just know that 
                    they're spaghetti code.
